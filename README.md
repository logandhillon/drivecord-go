## About

Drivecord is a project made for educational purposes, made to store your files using Discord's content delivery network (CDN).

## FAQ

### How does it work?

Your files are processed locally on your web browser, using client-sided JavaScript, then are posted to a private Discord server using a webhook. Drivecord GO does not store any pointers to these files, the URLs you generate are entirely static.

### Is it secure?

Yes, if you enable encryption. Encryption will encrypt your files with a random key, ensuring no one without the key can read the files.

Disabling encryption will store your files on the Discord server in source format, which is not recommended.

### Can I get banned from Discord?

Your account is not connected to Drivecord or Drivecord GO in any way.
